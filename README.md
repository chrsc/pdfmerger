# pdfmerger

PDFMerger update from original code to use updated libraries.

The reason why I created this repo, I couldn't get the merger to work when SSLv3
was disabled; the old code was using FPDF v1.3 and FPDI v1.3.1 which are outdated
now. The new versions of the libraries work with SSLv3 disabled. 

## Installation
